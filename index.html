				I&rsquo;m a <b>syntactician</b> focused on morphosyntactic variation, a <b>psycholinguist</b> specializing in incremental sentence comprehension, and <b>fieldworker</b> with research expertise in Georgian. Currently I work as postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at Princeton&rsquo;s <a href="https://linguistics.princeton.edu/">Program in Linguistics</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://linguistics.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a> in 2020. <a href="assets/pdfs/Foley_CV.pdf">Here&rsquo;s a pdf of my CV.</a>
				</p>

				<p>One perspective of my research addresses how language comprehenders leverage word-internal information (e.g., case morphology or animacy) to <b>infer word-external syntactic relationships</b> (e.g., subjecthood, subordination) in real time. This typically involves collecting behavioral data, like reading times and acceptability judgements. From another perspective, I theorize about <b>why complex grammatical patterns might emerge</b> across languages and across time. This involves a combination of linguistic fieldwork, corpus research, computational modeling, and combing grammatical descriptions of languages spoken around the world.
				</p>

				<p>My current research projects are all collaborative experimental ventures. With <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ninoamiridze/">Nino Amiridze</a>, I am investigating morphological variation in a type of <b>non-standard verbal compound</b> in Georgian, which has theoretical ramifications for diachronic theories of inflectional restructuring and synchronic theories of wordbuilding. With <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lea-Nash">LÃ©a Nash</a>, I am designing reading-time studies that will test how Georgian comprehenders use case to interpret <b>long-distance <i>wh</i>-dependencies</b>. And with <a href="https://www.byronahn.com/index.html">Byron Ahn</a> and <a href="http://www.kirbyconrod.com/">Kirby Conrod</a>, I am seeking correlations between behavioral data and sociolinguistic variables to understand ongoing grammatical change in the use of <b>singular <i>they</i></b>.

				</p>

				<p>
				I&rsquo;ve also worked on phi-agreement, pronominal cliticization, and relative clauses. At UCSC, I was involved in several collaborative projects investigating <a href="https://zapotec.ucsc.edu/">Santiago Laxopa Zapotec</a> and its rich grammar of animacy.
				</p>

				<p>
				The <b>experimental methodologies</b> I&rsquo;m most fluent in are acceptability judgement studies, self-paced reading (and its variants), visual-world eyetracking, and eyetracking-while-reading. I&rsquo;m comfortable <b>analyzing</b> behavioral data with linear mixed models and Signal Detection Theory.
				</p>

				<p>
				A life-long hobby of mine is visual art &mdash; take a look at some of my drawings and collages in the <i>Art</i> tab. I also have a fledgling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-zvmKF3qOxeWSXRDL6fHhQ">YouTube channel</a>, where I plan to post more linguistics content in the future.
				</p>

				<p>
				I prefer that you refer to me with <i>they/them</i> pronouns, but I don&rsquo;t mind <i>he/him</i>.
