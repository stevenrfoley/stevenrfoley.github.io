		<button class="accordion">Gradient acceptability of Georgian placeholder verbs</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>In collaboration with Dr Nino Amiridze, I examine a verbal construction in colloquial Georgian whose many quirks relevant to morphological theory. Descriptively, the placeholder verb /imaskʰna/ is a combination of (minimally) the demonstrative pronoun /imas/ “that:DAT” and the light verb /kʰna/ “do:NMLZ”. Pragmatically, the placeholder verb is used as a syntactic filler when a speaker either cannot recall or wishes to euphemistically avoid a lexically contentful verb. Morphologically, it is the most complex verb in the language — exhibiting seemingly sui generis patterns of stem suppletion and multiply exponed phi-agreement. Data collection is currently ongoing for a large-scale morphological acceptability study targeting placeholder verbs’ unique properties (task: Likert-scale wellformedness judgement). The experiment is designed to tease apart possible theoretical analyses of the construction (compounding vs. infixation vs. incorporation), and to test predicted restrictions on the locality of allomorphy.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Morphophonology of Georgian truncated compounds</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Another compounding strategy in Georgian involves the combination of two verbs, typically with the same root but varying in directional/deictic prefixes. Usually, the first member of the compound is stripped of all of its suffixes. However, a survey of truncated compound verbs in a large dictionary (Rayfield 2006) and the Georgian National Corpus reveals a few systematic exceptions to this generalization: suffixes in the first verb can survive truncation, seemingly due to subtle morphophonological constraints on stem-shape and syllabicity. Data collection for morphological acceptability study is ongoing (task: a forced-choice between totally and partially truncated compounds); it is designed to test the robustness of these exceptions, in addition to more speculative hypotheses about the perception of liminal syllabicity in Georgian.

		<button class="accordion">Psychosociolinguistics of singular <i>they</i></button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>An ongoing collaborative project (PIs Prof Byron Ahn and Dr Kirby Conrod) involves a set of experiments on the comprehension and production of singular they in contemporary American English. We wish to better understand how social variables correlate with the use and perception of this pronoun, which has three major uses: the pronoun can be anaphoric to a definite plural referent; it can covary with a quantified/indefinite noun phrase; or (in the most innovative use) it can refer to a definite singular individual, especially a non-binary person. I am collaborating on the design of two singular-they experiments (an acceptability study and a sentence-completion task), and spearheading the construction of a third experiment — a self-paced reading-time study looking at sentences with they in a (potentially) cataphoric position, manipulating the number of the subsequent matrix subject. Number mismatch effects — e.g., slower reading times at plural matrix subjects following singular cataphors — have been previously documented in the reading times of similarly shaped sentences. This indicates that comprehenders actively anticipate a matrix-subject postcedent upon encountering a pronoun within left-peripheral embedded clauses. We plan to test the strength of the number mismatch effect across populations hypothesized to accept definite-singular they to different degrees. Should, say, cis-gendered comphrenders exhibit a greater number mismatch than nonbinary comprehenders, it would show that sociolinguistic variables like gender correlate even with very fine-grained, subliminal incremental syntactic comprehension behavior.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Realtime comprehension of Georgian split ergativity</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Georgian’s three-way tense-conditioned split-ergative case system radically dissociates noun phrases’ morphological inflection from their syntactic role — e.g., transitive subjects might be marked nominative in the future, ergative in the past, or dative in the perfect. Consequently, incremental syntactic-role ambiguities abound in even the language’s simplest sentences. I have previously investigated this comprehension conundrum in a pair of self-paced reading-time studies, manipulating the case marking, word order, and animacy of preverbal noun phrases. A key finding is that Georgian comprehenders navigate case–role ambiguities by optimizing the alignment of animacy and syntactic prominence: ambiguous human arguments are initially parsed as the most prominent role compatible with their case, while ambiguous inanimates are parsed as the least-prominent possible role (Foley 2020:Ch.2; Foley & Wagers 2020). Ongoing experimental work seeks to replicate this core finding, and test the robustness of predicted ditransitive parses which would optimize incremental animacy–role alignment in certain types of sentences. Data collection for this new self-paced reading study using the lexicality-Maze methodology.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Realtime comprehension of Georgian filler–gap dependencies</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Filler–gap dependencies like relativization and wh-movement are well studied in sentence processing. My work, previous and ongoing, work contributes to theories of filler–gap processing by leveraging Georgian’s unique grammatical properties — especially its split-ergative case system, and the strategies for forming relative clauses and wh-questions. Manipulating factors make it possible to untangle contributions of incremental case cues, structural filler–gap distance, and word order, all within a single language. The key finding is an ergative garden-path effect: within relative clauses, ergative-marked nouns are read much more slowly than nominative ones (Foley 2020: Ch.3; Foley & Wagers 2017). I interpret this as evidence that Georgian comprehenders default to a subject-gap interpretation upon encountering cues for a filler–gap dependency: replicating the subject-gap advantage robustly documented in more typologically familiar languages. Ongoing collaborative work with Prof Léa Nash builds on these results, expanding the scope to wh-questions, cross-clausal filler–gap dependencies, and other incremental argument-structure ambiguities; we plan to run an off-line acceptability study and a lexicality-Maze reading-time experiment.</p>

		<h2><b>Past Projects</b></h2><br>
		<button class="accordion">Information-theoretic constraints on case typology</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Entropy is an abstract mathematical measure of a system’s unpredictability; within natural language, the more entropic a grammatical relationship (e.g., the link between a clausal argument’s case and syntactic role), the harder it will be to both comprehend and produce. A long-standing intuition in linguistic typology is that a primary function of case morphology is to efficiently disambiguate clausal coarguments. This predicts that language use and acquisition will favor case-alignment grammars with more predictable (i.e., less entropic) relationships between morphology and syntactic role, especially in transitive clauses. To test this intuition, I first estimated entropy values quanitifying the complexity of a Georgian’s split-ergative case alignment, calculating conditional case–role probabilities from Georgian National Corpus data. Then, I remapped the Georgian corpus data to another 17 attested case alignment systems, calculating the same entropy values for them so as to contextualize Georgian’s case-alignment entropy to other naturalistic systems. Finally, I automatically generated another ~20,000 case-alignment grammars, again remapping the Georgian data in order to simulate the space of logically possible case systems. Comparing the entropy values calculated for Georgian, the naturalistic languages, and the simulated ones, a tantalizing generalization emerges. In general, the conditional entropy of case morphology given an intended syntactic role is more tightly constrained in the naturalistic sample than is conditional entropy of role given an observed case. In otherwords, it seems harder to correctly inflect a noun for case during speaking than it is to parse a noun’s role based on its case during listening. Production, therefore, might be a stronger driver of morphosyntactic typology than comprehension is.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Processing resumption in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec relative clauses</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (SLZ; Oto-Manguean) is a rigid VSO language with postnominal relative clauses with no overt A-bar operator. Extracted subjects and objects alike can be grammatically resumed; relative clauses without resumptive pronouns are ambiguous for gapsite. As part of a research group at UC Santa Cruz (including Dr Jed Pizarro-Guevara, Dr Kelsey Sasaki, Prof Maziar Toosarvandani, and Prof Matt Wagers), I helped design and run two field-psycholinguistic experiments that tested the incremental comprehension of SLZ relative clauses with and without resumptives. This involved fieldwork with SLZ speakers in California to construct stimuli; recording audio stimuli with one of these consultants; commissioning a Mexican artist to create visual stimuli that depicted possible interpretations of the stimuli sentences; and finally traveling to the remote mountain town of Santiago Laxopa in Oaxaca, Mexico to collect data over two summers. We ran an interpretation judgement study (involving participants choosing between two visual depictions of audio stimuli, presented on tablet computers) and an visual-world eyetracking study (using a non-invasive portable eyetracking device, connected to the same tablets). Both the on-line and off-line results indicated that SLZ speakers have a preference for subject-gap interpretations; comprehenders also seem to more readily parse relative-internal pronouns as resumptives than non-resumptive anaphoric pronouns.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Animacy-based restrictions on pronominal cliticization in Zapotec</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Santiago Laxopa Zapotec and closely related Sierra Zapotec languages exhibit a rich animacy-based contrast among its third-person pronouns, distinguishing categories for inanimates, animals, younger humans, and elder humans. Subject pronouns obligatorily encliticize to the clause-intial verb; object pronouns may also cliticize, but only if certain featural relationships between the arguments are met. Generally, the object only cliticizes if it is less animate than the subject, but the precise details are subject to microvariation across Sierra Zapotec. In collaboration with Dr Nick Kalivoda and Prof Maziar Toosarvandani, I developed a theory of pronominal licensing that can account for the attested cliticization constraints, linking it to the broader typology of similar person–case constraints on pronominal cliticization in more familiar languages like French or Greek. Besides expanding the typology of these constraints to the domain of animacy, the Sierra Zapotec facts support theoretical models in which pronouns move to satisfy featural needs of abstract probes, rather than their own structural deficiencies.</p>

		<button class="accordion">Surface-oriented generalizations in Georgian agreement</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>The intricate patterns of phi-agreement in Modern Standard Georgian are (in)famous in theoretical morphosyntax, having helped motivate contemporary theories of the operation Agree. However, I have argued that Georgian agreement patterns are not rooted in narrow-syntactic mechanisms; rather, they are better understood as a morphological conspiracy against the multiple exponence of certain features. In Foley (2017), I offer an OT-based analysis that succinctly captures the key surface-oriented generalizations; in Foley (2020:Ch.4), I flesh out a syntactic input to this morphological optimization that leverages a parallel between Georgian agreement and ‘Minimal Compliance’ phenomena in Bulgarian multiple <i>wh</i>-questions.</p>
